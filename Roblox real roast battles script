    "You’re trying too hard. Relax, it’s embarrassing.",
    "That's adorable. Now, try hitting your target.",
    "You playing with your eyes closed, or what?",
    "You planning on joining the game, or just spectating?",
    "Wow, you missed… again. Impressive consistency.",
    "Is that aim, or are you just drawing circles?",
    "You aiming for me, or trying to hit the sky?",
    "Your reactions are slower than my grandma’s.",
    "You call that a strategy? My pet rock could do better.",
    "Are you lagging, or just naturally slow?",
    "At this rate, you’ll reach level 2 by next year.",
    "You here to play, or just showing off noob skills?",
    "You must have the world record… for missing.",
    "No worries, buddy, maybe next century.",
    "Try aiming with your eyes open next time.",
    "Oh, did you mean to miss every shot?",
    "Were you trying? It didn’t look like it.",
    "Nice try, but let’s leave winning to the pros.",
    "You came here to lose, didn’t you?",
    "Didn’t realize Roblox had bots like you.",
    "You call that a comeback? More like a fall-back.",
    "Pro tip: stop aiming at the floor.",
    "Maybe put a little effort in next time.",
    "Is your strategy just ‘hope and pray?’",
    "You know you can actually try, right?",
    "Oh wow, another miss. Shocker.",
    "You look lost. Want a map?",
    "Trying to be scary? Cute.",
    "Just stand still, you’re more useful that way.",
    "I’ve seen better moves from an NPC.",
    "You're here for the participation trophy, right?",
    "Were you aiming for the ground on purpose?",
    "Might want to reconsider your strategy there.",
    "Is that all you've got? Disappointing.",
    "Playing like that, you’re practically a spectator.",
    "Any reason you’re not even trying?",
    "That was sad. Maybe try again next year?",
    "You here for the free loss? You're welcome.",
    "Playing hard to lose, I see.",
    "Thought you were good? Think again.",
    "Are you new? Or just terrible?",
    "Trying to impress someone? Not working.",
    "Keep trying, one day you might actually hit something.",
    "This your first time, or are you always this bad?",
    "If missing was a skill, you'd be pro.",
    "Nice attempt. Too bad it failed.",
    "I'm almost impressed by how bad you are.",
    "That’s embarrassing, even for you.",
    "Your aim is about as good as your trash talk.",
    "Try again, because that was laughable.",
    "Not even close. Maybe try actually aiming.",
    "Were you going for comedy with that play?",
    "Did you think that would work? Adorable.",
    "Congratulations, you achieved nothing.",
    "You sure you're playing the right game?",
    "You're making this way too easy for me.",
    "That was sad, even for you.",
    "Oh, you were serious? My bad.",
    "Trying to win? Not looking like it.",
    "Better luck next time. Or never.",
    "Missed again. You’re consistent, at least.",
    "Did you mean to miss every time?",
    "You play like you’ve got lag… in life.",
    "Trying to make a statement with that fail?",
    "That was impressive…ly terrible.",
    "Keep that up, and you’ll be on a losing streak.",
    "Oh, is that all? Yawn.",
    "You’re trying, aren’t you? How sad.",
    "Were you aiming for failure? Nailed it.",
    "Look at you! Losing like it’s an art form.",
    "How are you this bad? Honestly curious.",
    "Do you practice being this terrible?",
    "You play like you’re allergic to skill.",
    "No need to try so hard to fail; it’s natural for you.",
    "Yikes, that was embarrassing.",
    "You call that skill? Look again.",
    "If missing was a competition, you'd take first place.",
    "Do you always play this badly, or just today?",
    "Oh, were you trying to win? Couldn’t tell.",
    "At this point, I think the bots are better than you.",
    "I’d say try harder, but this is sad enough.",
    "You might as well log out at this point.",
    "You’re here for the laughs, right?",
    "That aim needs a restraining order from success.",
    "You’ve got the reaction time of a brick.",
    "Try again, because that was tragic.",
    "Next time, bring your skills with you.",
    "Keep going, maybe you’ll miss less… someday.",
    "Oh, look, another epic fail.",
    "You’re about as helpful as a glitch.",
    "That was your move? Ha, good one.",
    "Playing like you’re trying to lose? Nailed it.",
    "You’re here to watch me win, right?",
    "Is that your best impression of a noob?",
    "Playing like it’s your first time, I see.",
    "I’d say ‘good try,’ but that’d be lying.",
    "Trying to embarrass yourself? Mission accomplished.",
    "Your gameplay is an insult to tutorials.",
    "Oh look, you failed again. Consistency!",
    "Did you even read the controls?",
    "You trying to break a record for misses?",
    "If failure was a skill, you’d be top-tier.",
    "Trying to compete with a bot, or just failing?",
    "That was… pathetic.",
    "You’re a living ‘how not to play’ guide.",
    "You sure you’re ready for this game?",
    "That was sad. Even for a noob.",
    "You’re about as intimidating as a kitten.",
    "Maybe next time, buddy. Or not.",
    "Trying to make that look hard? Nailed it.",
    "At least you’re consistent… at failing.",
    "Did you mean to miss every shot?",
    "You’re playing like you’ve got your eyes closed.",
    "Is this supposed to be challenging?",
    "Oh, that was you trying? Yikes.",
    "You do know we’re supposed to hit things, right?",
    "Trying your best? How unfortunate.",
    "Another shot missed? Keep ‘em coming!",
    "If that’s all you’ve got, I’ll take the win.",
    "Playing like a noob’s champion, I see.",
    "Congrats on reaching new levels of failure.",
    "Yawn. Was that supposed to be hard?",
    "You’re the most consistent noob I’ve seen.",
    "How do you miss that badly?",
    "Was that an attempt, or are you trolling?",
    "Impressive... if we’re grading on a curve for noobs.",
    "At least your aim is reliably terrible.",
    "Did you forget to equip your skills?",
    "Were you trying? Couldn’t tell.",
    "Nice strategy… if failure was the goal.",
    "Your gameplay should be a meme.",
    "Trying to break records for missing?",
    "That’s cute. Keep trying, little buddy.",
    "I’d say ‘close,’ but that was nowhere near.",
    "Watching you play is like watching a car crash.",
    "If trying hard was a skill, you’d still fail.",
    "Is there a skill somewhere in there? Couldn’t find it.",
    "You’re really making this easy for me.",
    "Maybe you should leave it to the pros.",
    "Trying to hit me? You might want to aim.",
    "Your gameplay is an achievement… in failure.",
    "Is that all you’ve got? Weak.",
    "You call that aiming? Try again.",
    "Trying to be bad, or is it just natural?",
    "Missed again? Keep it up, you’re on a roll.",
    "I didn’t know bots played this badly.",
    "Keep dreaming if you think you’ll win.",
    "You really went for that, huh? Sad.",
    "Oh, was that an attempt? Cute.",
    "The only thing you’re hitting is rock bottom.",
    "You trying to lose, or are you just this talented?",
    "That all you got? I thought you were a threat.",
    "Oh, you’re serious? That’s unfortunate.",
    "You missed again… that’s kind of your thing, huh?",
    "Trying your hardest? Hate to see it.",
    "You aiming for the leaderboard, or just looking lost?",
    "Was that an attempt? Didn’t even feel it.",
    "Keep going, I’m sure you’ll get close one day.",
    "Nice effort! Too bad it wasn’t enough.",
    "Is this you at your best, or just having a bad day?",
    "Next time, try using both hands.",
    "Can’t tell if you’re trying to win or just trolling.",
    "Looks like you’re struggling. Need a tutorial?",
    "Oh, did you mean to whiff that hard?",
    "Didn’t realize this was a one-sided game.",
    "Looks like your skills went AFK.",
    "You do know the point is to hit things, right?",
    "Good job missing everything again.",
    "You're about as dangerous as a paperclip.",
    "Why don’t you just spectate? Might be safer.",
    "You came here to play or just boost my stats?",
    "I almost felt that… almost.",
    "Your aim needs GPS to find me.",
    "Another one missed! You’re really consistent.",
    "Trying hard to keep that loss streak going?",
    "You’re about as threatening as a pop-up ad.",
    "Did you really think that would work? Hilarious.",
    "You’re making my job way too easy.",
    "Oh, you’re aiming for the ground now? Bold strategy.",
    "Were you even trying with that move?",
    "That’s your best? Yikes, I expected more.",
    "Gotta love the dedication to failure.",
    "Missed again? Stick around, it’s getting funny.",
    "If noob was a brand, you'd be the face.",
    "Oh, is this beginner’s luck? Because it’s bad.",
    "Still trying? Respect for the persistence.",
    "Looks like you brought a spoon to a sword fight.",
    "Were you hoping for sympathy? Try harder.",
    "That miss was almost impressive.",
    "You play like the game’s on hard mode… just for you.",
    "Oh, nice! Another failure for the collection.",
    "I'm starting to think the bots are better.",
    "You’re like an NPC, but somehow less useful.",
    "Let me know when you’re ready to actually try.",
    "You’re a walking tutorial of what not to do.",
    "Did you accidentally hit ‘play’? It shows.",
    "Your reflexes are slower than a loading screen.",
    "Looks like I’m carrying this match. Again.",
    "Were you aiming, or just waving at me?",
    "You’re here for moral support, right?",
    "Your attempts are making this way too easy.",
    "Keep trying, champ. Someday you’ll hit something.",
    "You call that skill? Stick to the sandbox.",
    "Oh wow, missed again. Shocking.",
    "Your playstyle is about as sharp as a bowling ball.",
    "Good effort! Too bad it wasn’t good enough.",
    "I didn’t realize Roblox had a ‘clown’ mode.",
    "Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me: you’re bad.",
    "You’re so good at missing, it’s almost impressive.",
    "If this was golf, you’d be winning.",
    "Oh, you thought you had me? That’s cute.",
    "That was your best shot? Please.",
    "I’d give you advice, but I don’t think it’d help.",
    "You’re as deadly as a rubber band.",
    "Did you want a tutorial or are you good?",
    "If at first you don’t succeed, try missing again.",
    "I almost broke a sweat… laughing.",
    "Trying to surprise me? You surprised yourself.",
    "That was tragic. Do you even know how to aim?",
    "You're out here practicing, right? Gotta be.",
    "Can I send you a tutorial link?",
    "Were you trying to intimidate me? Try harder.",
    "Keep swinging in the dark; maybe you’ll hit something.",
    "You’re on the wrong side of impressive.",
    "Was that supposed to be threatening? Didn’t work.",
    "Nice try, but I’m still waiting for a challenge.",
    "Look at you, redefining the word ‘noob.’",
    "You’d be dangerous if you knew what you were doing.",
    "Oh, did I hurt your ego? My bad.",
    "That was almost funny… almost.",
    "Do you even know what the point of the game is?",
    "Playing like that, you’re just boosting my stats.",
    "Thanks for making this so easy.",
    "Did you come here to play, or just practice missing?",
    "Not sure if you’re trying to win or testing out noob mode.",
    "You make the bots look like professionals.",
    "Is this a warm-up? Because you’re ice cold.",
    "Congrats on achieving nothing again.",
    "Was that supposed to be impressive? Try again.",
    "Gonna need a map for that aim of yours.",
    "Are you here to play or just observe?",
    "Almost hit me there! Just kidding, not even close.",
    "You playing with mittens on or what?",
    "That was your move? Maybe rethink it.",
    "I’d call that effort, but it barely qualifies.",
    "Trying to keep your losing streak alive?",
    "Oh look, another miss. Keep it up, you’re on fire.",
    "That was cute. Try something real next time.",
    "Your attempt was about as useful as a paper cut.",
    "Playing like it’s your first day, huh?",
    "If you’re the competition, I might as well nap.",
    "Trying to look intimidating? It’s not working.",
    "You’re like the backup dancer in this game.",
    "Missing everything on purpose? Bold choice.",
    "You should really start aiming. It’s helpful.",
    "You’re like an unskippable ad—annoying and useless.",
    "Trying to be scary? You’re about as scary as a puppy.",
    "If points were for missing, you'd be winning.",
    "Just here to boost my stats? Thanks, appreciate it.",
    "Trying to make that look hard? Impressive dedication.",
    "I’d say nice try, but let’s be real, it wasn’t.",
    "Gotta love the confidence for someone so bad.",
    "Playing like you’ve got the skills of a potato.",
    "Is this a sneak attack, or just poor aim?",
    "You sure you’re ready for this level?",
    "That move had about as much impact as a breeze.",
    "Let me know when you’re done practicing.",
    "Still going with that strategy, huh? Bold.",
    "Didn’t realize I signed up for a noob convention.",
    "Your aim’s got more plot twists than a bad movie.",
    "Almost there! Just kidding, you missed.",
    "Trying to look impressive? It’s failing.",
    "Are you here for the free loss? Looks like it.",
    "That aim’s got as much precision as a potato cannon.",
    "You missed again? Keep that streak alive.",
    "Did you even read the controls before playing?",
    "That was cute. Try an actual strategy next time.",
    "You're the best at being the worst.",
    "I’ve seen more coordination in a toddler.",
    "Trying to give me an advantage? Appreciate it.",
    "Did you just mash buttons and hope for the best?",
    "Still missing? You’ve really mastered that.",
    "You're like a tutorial, but with less hope.",
    "Thanks for giving me the easy route to victory.",
    "That was a nice attempt. Emphasis on attempt.",
    "Trying to keep your noob reputation strong?",
    "You’re like a welcome mat for victories.",
    "That was your big move? How sad.",
    "Playing like you just discovered the game exists.",
    "You’re making the bots look good.",
    "You’re really giving ‘noob’ a new meaning.",
    "Trying to lose with style? Almost nailed it.",
    "You call that a strategy? More like a comedy.",
    "If aim was free, you’d still have none.",
    "Keep that up, you’ll reach noob hall of fame.",
    "Is this your first game? No shame, just curious.",
    "Oh wow, another miss. Shocked, truly.",
    "Are you here to play, or just clowning around?",
    "Your aim’s like a broken compass—lost.",
    "Next time, try aiming for the target, not the air.",
    "Is this a speedrun of failure? You’re winning.",
    "I’d roast you harder, but it might lag the game.",
    "Trying to win? Couldn’t tell.",
    "Watching you play is like watching paint dry.",
    "You’ve got all the skill of a potato with lag.",
    "Your aim has plot holes bigger than this game.",
    "Trying your best? Could’ve fooled me.",
    "At this rate, even the bots pity you.",
    "Oh look, another epic fail.",
    "Did you even try to hit me, or was that a prank?",
    "You’re as threatening as a plush toy.",
    "Are you even playing, or is your cat on the keyboard?",
    "With aim like that, even the NPCs are rooting for me.",
    "Your strategy is as solid as melted butter.",
    "If I wanted a challenge, I’d ask for a refund.",
    "Do you even know how to aim, or just guessing?",
    "When you’re ready to try, I’ll still be waiting.",
    "I could dodge you in my sleep. No lie.",
    "Did you seriously just miss that? Impressive.",
    "Do you come with instructions? Because you need them.",
    "If this was a talent show, you’d be invisible.",
    "Oh, are you still trying? Good luck, you’ll need it.",
    "The game called… it’s not impressed.",
    "I could hit AFK players with more difficulty.",
    "Are you competing for ‘Most Misses’? You’ve won.",
    "You’re about as sharp as a broken pencil.",
    "Keep it up, and you might unlock the ‘Eternal Noob’ title.",
    "I’ve seen laggy servers with better precision.",
    "You couldn’t hit water if you fell out of a boat.",
    "Is that a dance move, or are you just lost?",
    "You know we’re supposed to hit each other, right?",
    "I feel like I’m fighting a tutorial bot.",
    "I think you missed the part about ‘trying to win.’",
    "Your gameplay makes cardboard look dynamic.",
    "Not sure if you’re trolling or genuinely this bad.",
    "I’m honestly impressed by your dedication to losing.",
    "You’d be scary… if I closed my eyes.",
    "Playing like that, you’d lose in spectator mode.",
    "I’d roast you, but the game might report me for bullying.",
    "Are you training for a career in missing?",
    "Do you need a second to catch up?",
    "When you’re done playing like a tourist, let me know.",
    "I bet even the bots feel bad for you.",
    "Your strategy is as confusing as your aim.",
    "Nice moves! If the goal was to embarrass yourself.",
    "I didn’t know Roblox had invisible difficulty levels.",
    "You’re like a warm-up round that never ends.",
    "Do you need a tutorial, or are you okay?",
    "Did you think you hit me? That’s adorable.",
    "If misses were XP, you’d be max level by now.",
    "I’m still waiting for you to actually try.",
    "I’ve seen more accurate throwing from a toddler.",
    "Congratulations, you’re consistently inconsistent.",
    "You’re about as effective as a wet sponge.",
    "Do you even have a plan, or are you winging it?",
    "With skills like that, even luck can’t save you.",
    "Playing like that, you should be an NPC.",
    "Your gameplay is a meme that writes itself.",
    "Oh look, another hit… on your own ego.",
    "Maybe try aiming at me next time.",
    "This might be a new low, even for you.",
    "If only your aim was as big as your ego.",
    "Are you sure this is your final form?",
    "Is this performance art, or just bad playing?",
    "Your gameplay is the real cringe compilation.",
    "Oh, you’re serious? Thought you were just warming up.",
    "If missing was a skill, you’d be world champ.",
    "I’ve dodged better hits in a loading screen.",
    "You know ‘aiming’ is a thing, right?",
    "You play like you’re allergic to winning.",
    "The game doesn’t stand a chance… against your misses.",
    "You aiming at the floor for a reason?",
    "If that was a flex, consider it failed.",
    "Trying to impress me? Mission not accomplished.",
    "Even my shadow’s better at hitting me.",
    "You’re like a meme, but without the humor.",
    "Maybe you should try with the training wheels on.",
    "Does your character come with a manual? You need it.",
    "You’re like the fine print of players—easily ignored.",
    "I’d suggest you sit this one out for your own safety.",
    "I’d cheer for you, but I’d rather be honest.",
    "If losing was a skill, you’d be elite.",
    "I’d ask for a rematch, but I’m already bored.",
    "You’re like a pop-up ad, just annoying.",
    "I could roast you more, but you’d miss that too.",
    "Do you need a map? You seem lost.",
    "That was almost cute… almost.",
    "Try aiming for once. You might surprise yourself.",
    "If skills were currency, you’d be in debt.",
    "You’ve got all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.",
    "You’re like the sequel no one wanted.",
    "You’re like a low-budget version of a real player.",
    "That was so bad, even the NPCs are laughing.",
    "Congrats on unlocking ‘Professional Noob.’",
    "Missed again? Keep practicing, kid.",
    "You should get an award for consistency in failure.",
    "Your skill level must be in another dimension.",
    "Playing like that, the tutorial boss could beat you.",
    "Your playstyle has as much edge as a marshmallow.",
    "Ever considered standing still? You’d miss less.",
    "If clueless was a game mode, you’d be top rank.",
    "You’re the reason bots have confidence.",
    "Thanks for making me feel like a pro.",
    "You’re about as coordinated as a shopping cart.",
    "It’s like you’re here to give out free wins.",
    "I didn’t know Roblox had a ‘practice miss’ mode.",
    "You sure you don’t need a timeout?",
    "You make noob level look like a career choice.",
    "The only thing you’re killing is my time.",
    "Ever thought about taking a skill break?",
    "Trying to make this interesting? Not working.",
    "You make guessing look like strategy.",
    "I’d say try harder, but it looks impossible for you.",
    "If disappointment was a sport, you’d be gold medalist.",
    "Nice job… on hitting everything except the target.",
    "At this rate, you’ll be famous for all the wrong reasons.",
    "Do you even know how to play, or just pretending?",
    "Is this supposed to be funny? Because it is.",
    "If skill levels had a basement, you’d be there.",
    "Oh, were you aiming? Could’ve fooled me.",
    "I’d call you a threat, but that’s too generous.",
    "Congrats on being consistently terrible.",
    "Are you aiming, or just trying to look busy?",
    "I’ve seen less tragic plays from AFK players.",
    "If this was your best shot, we’re in trouble.",
    "That’s your ‘A’ game? Looks more like an ‘F.’",
    "You’re about as threatening as a rubber duck.",
    "When you’re ready to play, let me know.",
    "Oh, did you think you’d win? That’s cute.",
    "Try aiming with your eyes open next time.",
    "You’re like the bonus round for easy points.",
    "Maybe next time try a little… or a lot harder.",
    "You’ve got all the finesse of a wrecking ball.",
    "That was about as effective as a paper shield.",
    "Is this your strategy, or just lack of aim?",
    "Looks like you’re aiming for rock bottom.",
    "Were you trying to win, or just here to watch?",
    "You’re making ‘noob’ look like an art form.",
    "Did you think you’d get away with that move?",
    "That attempt was as empty as your aim.",
    "You’re here for moral support, right?",
    "I could aim blindfolded and still do better.",
    "Was that a serious attempt, or just practice?",
    "That aim has as much chance as a lottery ticket.",
    "You’re like the ‘before’ picture in a tutorial.",
    "Was that move supposed to scare me?",
    "I’d be scared… if you actually hit something.",
    "You’re the reason noobs have their own ranking.",
    "I’ve seen laggier players with better aim.",
    "Did you just guess and hope for the best?",
    "You know we’re supposed to hit each other, right?",
    "Your strategy is about as effective as a placebo.",
    "Your aim is like a mystery… unsolved.",
    "That was a miss so big, even the game noticed.",
    "Oh, was that an attempt? Couldn’t tell.",
    "Nice try, but maybe next century?",
    "Trying your hardest? It doesn’t look like it.",
    "Oh, look, a new noob record. Congratulations!",
    "You’re like the ‘delete’ button on gameplay.",
    "Were you trying to look lost, or just talented?",
    "If this was hide-and-seek, you’d still lose.",
    "Trying to keep up? Looks like you’re in slow-mo.",
    "That was cute, but not even close.",
    "The only thing you’re close to is giving up.",
    "Nice moves, if the goal was to embarrass yourself.",
    "Looks like you’re fighting an invisible enemy.",
    "I’d say ‘good try,’ but let’s not lie.",
    "If aiming was a test, you’d still be studying.",
    "You aiming at me or the sky? Hard to tell.",
    "Did you just learn to play, or is this a talent?",
    "You're like a practice dummy that talks back.",
    "I could do this with my eyes closed. Oh wait, I am.",
    "Is this the highlight of your skill? Ouch.",
    "You're the reason we need a noob mode.",
    "At this rate, my grandma could dodge you.",
    "Is your strategy just guessing? Because it shows.",
    "Ever considered taking aim lessons?",
    "I didn’t know Roblox offered comedy routines.",
    "Nice moves! Are you sleepwalking?",
    "Not gonna lie, I thought you’d be more challenging.",
    "If disappointment was an award, you’d get first place.",
