    "You’re here to watch me win, right?",
    "Is that your best impression of a noob?",
    "Playing like it’s your first time, I see.",
    "I’d say ‘good try,’ but that’d be lying.",
    "Trying to embarrass yourself? Mission accomplished.",
    "Your gameplay is an insult to tutorials.",
    "Oh look, you failed again. Consistency!",
    "Did you even read the controls?",
    "You trying to break a record for misses?",
    "If failure was a skill, you’d be top-tier.",
    "Trying to compete with a bot, or just failing?",
    "That was… pathetic.",
    "You’re a living ‘how not to play’ guide.",
    "You sure you’re ready for this game?",
    "That was sad. Even for a noob.",
    "You’re about as intimidating as a kitten.",
    "Maybe next time, buddy. Or not.",
    "Trying to make that look hard? Nailed it.",
    "At least you’re consistent… at failing.",
    "Did you mean to miss every shot?",
    "You’re playing like you’ve got your eyes closed.",
    "Is this supposed to be challenging?",
    "Oh, that was you trying? Yikes.",
    "You do know we’re supposed to hit things, right?",
    "Trying your best? How unfortunate.",
    "Another shot missed? Keep ‘em coming!",
    "If that’s all you’ve got, I’ll take the win.",
    "Playing like a noob’s champion, I see.",
    "Congrats on reaching new levels of failure.",
    "Yawn. Was that supposed to be hard?",
    "You’re the most consistent noob I’ve seen.",
    "How do you miss that badly?",
    "Was that an attempt, or are you trolling?",
    "Impressive... if we’re grading on a curve for noobs.",
    "At least your aim is reliably terrible.",
    "Did you forget to equip your skills?",
    "Were you trying? Couldn’t tell.",
    "Nice strategy… if failure was the goal.",
    "Your gameplay should be a meme.",
    "Trying to break records for missing?",
    "That’s cute. Keep trying, little buddy.",
    "I’d say ‘close,’ but that was nowhere near.",
    "Watching you play is like watching a car crash.",
    "If trying hard was a skill, you’d still fail.",
    "Is there a skill somewhere in there? Couldn’t find it.",
    "You’re really making this easy for me.",
    "Maybe you should leave it to the pros.",
    "Trying to hit me? You might want to aim.",
    "Your gameplay is an achievement… in failure.",
    "Is that all you’ve got? Weak.",
    "You call that aiming? Try again.",
    "Trying to be bad, or is it just natural?",
    "Missed again? Keep it up, you’re on a roll.",
    "I didn’t know bots played this badly.",
    "Keep dreaming if you think you’ll win.",
    "You really went for that, huh? Sad.",
    "Oh, was that an attempt? Cute.",
    "The only thing you’re hitting is rock bottom.",
    "You trying to lose, or are you just this talented?",
    "That all you got? I thought you were a threat.",
    "Oh, you’re serious? That’s unfortunate.",
    "You missed again… that’s kind of your thing, huh?",
    "Trying your hardest? Hate to see it.",
    "You aiming for the leaderboard, or just looking lost?",
    "Was that an attempt? Didn’t even feel it.",
    "Keep going, I’m sure you’ll get close one day.",
    "Nice effort! Too bad it wasn’t enough.",
    "Is this you at your best, or just having a bad day?",
    "Next time, try using both hands.",
    "Can’t tell if you’re trying to win or just trolling.",
    "Looks like you’re struggling. Need a tutorial?",
    "Oh, did you mean to whiff that hard?",
    "Didn’t realize this was a one-sided game.",
    "Looks like your skills went AFK.",
    "You do know the point is to hit things, right?",
    "Good job missing everything again.",
    "You're about as dangerous as a paperclip.",
    "Why don’t you just spectate? Might be safer.",
    "You came here to play or just boost my stats?",
    "I almost felt that… almost.",
    "Your aim needs GPS to find me.",
    "Another one missed! You’re really consistent.",
    "Trying hard to keep that loss streak going?",
    "You’re about as threatening as a pop-up ad.",
    "Did you really think that would work? Hilarious.",
    "You’re making my job way too easy.",
    "Oh, you’re aiming for the ground now? Bold strategy.",
    "Were you even trying with that move?",
    "That’s your best? Yikes, I expected more.",
    "Gotta love the dedication to failure.",
    "Missed again? Stick around, it’s getting funny.",
    "If noob was a brand, you'd be the face.",
    "Oh, is this beginner’s luck? Because it’s bad.",
    "Still trying? Respect for the persistence.",
    "Looks like you brought a spoon to a sword fight.",
    "Were you hoping for sympathy? Try harder.",
    "That miss was almost impressive.",
    "You play like the game’s on hard mode… just for you.",
    "Oh, nice! Another failure for the collection.",
    "I'm starting to think the bots are better.",
    "You’re like an NPC, but somehow less useful.",
    "Let me know when you’re ready to actually try.",
    "You’re a walking tutorial of what not to do.",
    "Did you accidentally hit ‘play’? It shows.",
    "Your reflexes are slower than a loading screen.",
    "Looks like I’m carrying this match. Again.",
    "Were you aiming, or just waving at me?",
    "You’re here for moral support, right?",
    "Your attempts are making this way too easy.",
    "Keep trying, champ. Someday you’ll hit something.",
    "You call that skill? Stick to the sandbox.",
    "Oh wow, missed again. Shocking.",
    "Your playstyle is about as sharp as a bowling ball.",
    "Good effort! Too bad it wasn’t good enough.",
    "I didn’t realize Roblox had a ‘clown’ mode.",
    "Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me: you’re bad.",
    "You’re so good at missing, it’s almost impressive.",
    "If this was golf, you’d be winning.",
    "Oh, you thought you had me? That’s cute.",
    "That was your best shot? Please.",
    "I’d give you advice, but I don’t think it’d help.",
    "You’re as deadly as a rubber band.",
    "Did you want a tutorial or are you good?",
    "If at first you don’t succeed, try missing again.",
    "I almost broke a sweat… laughing.",
    "Trying to surprise me? You surprised yourself.",
    "That was tragic. Do you even know how to aim?",
    "You're out here practicing, right? Gotta be.",
    "Can I send you a tutorial link?",
    "Were you trying to intimidate me? Try harder.",
    "Keep swinging in the dark; maybe you’ll hit something.",
    "You’re on the wrong side of impressive.",
    "Was that supposed to be threatening? Didn’t work.",
    "Nice try, but I’m still waiting for a challenge.",
    "Look at you, redefining the word ‘noob.’",
    "You’d be dangerous if you knew what you were doing.",
    "Oh, did I hurt your ego? My bad.",
    "That was almost funny… almost.",
    "Do you even know what the point of the game is?",
    "Playing like that, you’re just boosting my stats.",
    "Thanks for making this so easy.",
    "Did you come here to play, or just practice missing?",
    "Not sure if you’re trying to win or testing out noob mode.",
    "You make the bots look like professionals.",
    "Is this a warm-up? Because you’re ice cold.",
    "Congrats on achieving nothing again.",
    "Was that supposed to be impressive? Try again.",
    "Gonna need a map for that aim of yours.",
    "Are you here to play or just observe?",
    "Almost hit me there! Just kidding, not even close.",
    "You playing with mittens on or what?",
    "That was your move? Maybe rethink it.",
    "I’d call that effort, but it barely qualifies.",
    "Trying to keep your losing streak alive?",
    "Oh look, another miss. Keep it up, you’re on fire.",
    "That was cute. Try something real next time.",
    "Your attempt was about as useful as a paper cut.",
    "Playing like it’s your first day, huh?",
    "If you’re the competition, I might as well nap.",
    "Trying to look intimidating? It’s not working.",
    "You’re like the backup dancer in this game.",
    "Missing everything on purpose? Bold choice.",
    "You should really start aiming. It’s helpful.",
    "You’re like an unskippable ad—annoying and useless.",
    "Trying to be scary? You’re about as scary as a puppy.",
    "If points were for missing, you'd be winning.",
    "Just here to boost my stats? Thanks, appreciate it.",
    "Trying to make that look hard? Impressive dedication.",
    "I’d say nice try, but let’s be real, it wasn’t.",
    "Gotta love the confidence for someone so bad.",
    "Playing like you’ve got the skills of a potato.",
    "Is this a sneak attack, or just poor aim?",
    "You sure you’re ready for this level?",
    "That move had about as much impact as a breeze.",
    "Let me know when you’re done practicing.",
    "Still going with that strategy, huh? Bold.",
    "Didn’t realize I signed up for a noob convention.",
    "Your aim’s got more plot twists than a bad movie.",
    "Almost there! Just kidding, you missed.",
    "Trying to look impressive? It’s failing.",
    "Are you here for the free loss? Looks like it.",
    "That aim’s got as much precision as a potato cannon.",
    "You missed again? Keep that streak alive.",
    "Did you even read the controls before playing?",
    "That was cute. Try an actual strategy next time.",
    "You're the best at being the worst.",
    "I’ve seen more coordination in a toddler.",
    "Trying to give me an advantage? Appreciate it.",
    "Did you just mash buttons and hope for the best?",
    "Still missing? You’ve really mastered that.",
    "You're like a tutorial, but with less hope.",
    "Thanks for giving me the easy route to victory.",
    "That was a nice attempt. Emphasis on attempt.",
    "Trying to keep your noob reputation strong?",
    "You’re like a welcome mat for victories.",
    "That was your big move? How sad.",
    "Playing like you just discovered the game exists.",
    "You’re making the bots look good.",
    "You’re really giving ‘noob’ a new meaning.",
    "Trying to lose with style? Almost nailed it.",
    "You call that a strategy? More like a comedy.",
    "If aim was free, you’d still have none.",
    "Keep that up, you’ll reach noob hall of fame.",
    "Is this your first game? No shame, just curious.",
    "Oh wow, another miss. Shocked, truly.",
    "Are you here to play, or just clowning around?",
    "Your aim’s like a broken compass—lost.",
    "Next time, try aiming for the target, not the air.",
    "Is this a speedrun of failure? You’re winning.",
    "I’d roast you harder, but it might lag the game.",
    "Trying to win? Couldn’t tell.",
    "Watching you play is like watching paint dry.",
    "You’ve got all the skill of a potato with lag.",
    "Your aim has plot holes bigger than this game.",
    "Trying your best? Could’ve fooled me.",
    "At this rate, even the bots pity you.",
    "Oh look, another epic fail.",
    "Did you even try to hit me, or was that a prank?",
    "You’re as threatening as a plush toy.",
    "Are you even playing, or is your cat on the keyboard?",
    "With aim like that, even the NPCs are rooting for me.",
    "Your strategy is as solid as melted butter.",
    "If I wanted a challenge, I’d ask for a refund.",
    "Do you even know how to aim, or just guessing?",
    "When you’re ready to try, I’ll still be waiting.",
    "I could dodge you in my sleep. No lie.",
    "Did you seriously just miss that? Impressive.",
    "Do you come with instructions? Because you need them.",
    "If this was a talent show, you’d be invisible.",
    "Oh, are you still trying? Good luck, you’ll need it.",
    "The game called… it’s not impressed.",
    "I could hit AFK players with more difficulty.",
    "Are you competing for ‘Most Misses’? You’ve won.",
    "You’re about as sharp as a broken pencil.",
    "Keep it up, and you might unlock the ‘Eternal Noob’ title.",
    "I’ve seen laggy servers with better precision.",
    "You couldn’t hit water if you fell out of a boat.",
    "Is that a dance move, or are you just lost?",
    "You know we’re supposed to hit each other, right?",
    "I feel like I’m fighting a tutorial bot.",
    "I think you missed the part about ‘trying to win.’",
    "Your gameplay makes cardboard look dynamic.",
    "Not sure if you’re trolling or genuinely this bad.",
    "I’m honestly impressed by your dedication to losing.",
    "You’d be scary… if I closed my eyes.",
    "Playing like that, you’d lose in spectator mode.",
    "I’d roast you, but the game might report me for bullying.",
    "Are you training for a career in missing?",
    "Do you need a second to catch up?",
    "When you’re done playing like a tourist, let me know.",
    "I bet even the bots feel bad for you.",
    "Your strategy is as confusing as your aim.",
    "Nice moves! If the goal was to embarrass yourself.",
    "I didn’t know Roblox had invisible difficulty levels.",
    "You’re like a warm-up round that never ends.",
    "Do you need a tutorial, or are you okay?",
    "Did you think you hit me? That’s adorable.",
    "If misses were XP, you’d be max level by now.",
    "I’m still waiting for you to actually try.",
    "I’ve seen more accurate throwing from a toddler.",
    "Congratulations, you’re consistently inconsistent.",
    "You’re about as effective as a wet sponge.",
    "Do you even have a plan, or are you winging it?",
    "With skills like that, even luck can’t save you.",
    "Playing like that, you should be an NPC.",
    "Your gameplay is a meme that writes itself.",
    "Oh look, another hit… on your own ego.",
    "Maybe try aiming at me next time.",
    "This might be a new low, even for you.",
    "If only your aim was as big as your ego.",
    "Are you sure this is your final form?",
    "Is this performance art, or just bad playing?",
    "Your gameplay is the real cringe compilation.",
    "Oh, you’re serious? Thought you were just warming up.",
    "If missing was a skill, you’d be world champ.",
    "I’ve dodged better hits in a loading screen.",
    "You know ‘aiming’ is a thing, right?",
    "You play like you’re allergic to winning.",
    "The game doesn’t stand a chance… against your misses.",
    "You aiming at the floor for a reason?",
    "If that was a flex, consider it failed.",
    "Trying to impress me? Mission not accomplished.",
    "Even my shadow’s better at hitting me.",
    "You’re like a meme, but without the humor.",
    "Maybe you should try with the training wheels on.",
    "Does your character come with a manual? You need it.",
    "You’re like the fine print of players—easily ignored.",
    "I’d suggest you sit this one out for your own safety.",
    "I’d cheer for you, but I’d rather be honest.",
    "If losing was a skill, you’d be elite.",
    "I’d ask for a rematch, but I’m already bored.",
    "You’re like a pop-up ad, just annoying.",
    "I could roast you more, but you’d miss that too.",
    "Do you need a map? You seem lost.",
    "That was almost cute… almost.",
    "Try aiming for once. You might surprise yourself.",
    "If skills were currency, you’d be in debt.",
    "You’ve got all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.",
    "You’re like the sequel no one wanted.",
    "You’re like a low-budget version of a real player.",

    "You’re the reason bots have confidence.",
    "Thanks for making me feel like a pro.",
    "You’re about as coordinated as a shopping cart.",
    "It’s like you’re here to give out free wins.",
    "I didn’t know Roblox had a ‘practice miss’ mode.",
    "You sure you don’t need a timeout?",
    "You make noob level look like a career choice.",
    "The only thing you’re killing is my time.",
    "Ever thought about taking a skill break?",
    "Trying to make this interesting? Not working.",
    "You make guessing look like strategy.",
    "I’d say try harder, but it looks impossible for you.",
    "If disappointment was a sport, you’d be gold medalist.",
    "Nice job… on hitting everything except the target.",
    "At this rate, you’ll be famous for all the wrong reasons.",
    "Do you even know how to play, or just pretending?",
    "Is this supposed to be funny? Because it is.",
    "If skill levels had a basement, you’d be there.",
    "Oh, were you aiming? Could’ve fooled me.",
    "I’d call you a threat, but that’s too generous.",
    "Congrats on being consistently terrible.",
    "Are you aiming, or just trying to look busy?",
    "I’ve seen less tragic plays from AFK players.",
    "If this was your best shot, we’re in trouble.",
    "That’s your ‘A’ game? Looks more like an ‘F.’",
    "You’re about as threatening as a rubber duck.",
    "When you’re ready to play, let me know.",
    "Oh, did you think you’d win? That’s cute.",
    "Try aiming with your eyes open next time.",
    "You’re like the bonus round for easy points.",
    "Maybe next time try a little… or a lot harder.",
    "You’ve got all the finesse of a wrecking ball.",
    "That was about as effective as a paper shield.",
    "Is this your strategy, or just lack of aim?",
    "Looks like you’re aiming for rock bottom.",
    "Were you trying to win, or just here to watch?",
    "You’re making ‘noob’ look like an art form.",
    "Did you think you’d get away with that move?",
    "That attempt was as empty as your aim.",
    "You’re here for moral support, right?",
    "I could aim blindfolded and still do better.",
    "Was that a serious attempt, or just practice?",
    "That aim has as much chance as a lottery ticket.",
    "You’re like the ‘before’ picture in a tutorial.",
    "Was that move supposed to scare me?",
    "I’d be scared… if you actually hit something.",
    "You’re the reason noobs have their own ranking.",
    "I’ve seen laggier players with better aim.",
    "Did you just guess and hope for the best?",
    "You know we’re supposed to hit each other, right?",
    "Your strategy is about as effective as a placebo.",
    "Your aim is like a mystery… unsolved.",
    "That was a miss so big, even the game noticed.",
    "Oh, was that an attempt? Couldn’t tell.",
    "Nice try, but maybe next century?",
    "Trying your hardest? It doesn’t look like it.",
    "Oh, look, a new noob record. Congratulations!",
    "You’re like the ‘delete’ button on gameplay.",
    "Were you trying to look lost, or just talented?",
    "If this was hide-and-seek, you’d still lose.",
    "Trying to keep up? Looks like you’re in slow-mo.",
    "That was cute, but not even close.",
    "The only thing you’re close to is giving up.",
    "Nice moves, if the goal was to embarrass yourself.",
    "Looks like you’re fighting an invisible enemy.",
    "I’d say ‘good try,’ but let’s not lie.",
    "If aiming was a test, you’d still be studying.",
    "You aiming at me or the sky? Hard to tell.",
    "Did you just learn to play, or is this a talent?",
    "You're like a practice dummy that talks back.",
    "I could do this with my eyes closed. Oh wait, I am.",
    "Is this the highlight of your skill? Ouch.",
    "You're the reason we need a noob mode.",
    "At this rate, my grandma could dodge you.",
    "Is your strategy just guessing? Because it shows.",
    "Ever considered taking aim lessons?",
    "I didn’t know Roblox offered comedy routines.",
    "Nice moves! Are you sleepwalking?",
    "Not gonna lie, I thought you’d be more challenging.",
    "If disappointment was an award, you’d get first place.",
    "Are you lagging, or is this your true skill?",

    "Is this game a challenge for you, or just life?",
    "Congratulations, you’ve unlocked the 'Miss Master' badge.",
    "You’re like a tutorial NPC, just with worse aim.",
    "If there was a prize for missing, you’d be gold medalist.",
    "You’d be dangerous if you were aiming at yourself.",
    "I’d call that a valiant effort, but it wasn’t.",
    "Are you waiting for inspiration to hit… or just missing?",
    "You're the boss fight nobody is afraid of.",
    "Did you accidentally hit the ‘lose’ button?",
    "You’re about as helpful as a flat tire.",
    "Your aim is so off, I feel safe standing still.",
    "Are you playing on hard mode? Just for yourself?",
    "I’d call you a threat, but it’s hard to take you seriously.",
    "You aiming for me, or are you sightseeing?",
    "Trying to keep that miss streak going? Respect.",
    "You’re like a low-budget tutorial that forgot how to aim.",
    "If aim was free, you’d still find a way to miss.",
    "Is this a joke, or is your aim really that bad?",
    "The only thing you’re hitting is a new low.",
    "You’d have better luck throwing your mouse.",
    "Trying to look tough? You just look lost.",
    "You know ‘aiming’ is allowed in this game, right?",
    "Oh, you missed again? Color me shocked.",
    "I’d say you’re giving it your all, but… nah.",
    "Trying to be sneaky? You’re about as stealthy as a foghorn.",
    "You play like your keyboard’s missing half the keys.",
    "You’re out here practicing how not to play, right?",
    "I’ve seen AFK players with better moves.",
    "If you aimed as much as you missed, I’d be in trouble.",
    "Are you here to compete, or just clown around?",
    "Your gameplay is the definition of ‘oops.’",
    "Trying to keep the floor safe? You’re doing great.",
    "Wow, you’re really leaning into that noob status.",
    "Missed again? You’re on a roll!",
    "If failure was XP, you’d be max level by now.",
    "You’re making this too easy. Like, way too easy.",
    "Did you think that would work? How cute.",
    "Your aim is about as useful as a broken compass.",
    "Are you testing the game’s patience or mine?",
    "Next time, aim with confidence. Or maybe just aim.",
    "Do you even know where I am? Just curious.",
    "I thought you’d at least be close. Wrong again.",
    "Playing like that, you’re just here for comic relief.",
    "Is it hard carrying that big noob energy?",
    "You’ve got the aim of a weather report—completely off.",
    "Are you using a potato as your controller?",
    "Trying to hit the broad side of a barn? Keep trying.",
    "Looks like you’ve mastered the art of missing.",
    "I almost felt that… almost.",
    "Trying to win? Could’ve fooled me.",
    "If missing shots was a talent, you’d be world class.",
    "Looks like you’re here just for practice.",
    "Were you aiming, or was that an accidental swing?",
    "You’ve got as much precision as a toddler with crayons.",
    "Next time, bring your A-game… or just any game.",
    "Your aim is the real horror story here.",
    "Is this just practice for you? Because it’s painful to watch.",
    "You’re like the NPC everyone forgets about.",
    "Maybe aim with your eyes open this time?",
    "If only there were points for trying.",
    "That was about as effective as a water balloon in a fire.",
    "Are you aiming, or just here to make me laugh?",
    "Next time you try that move, don’t.",
    "It’s like you’re allergic to accuracy.",
    "Looks like you’re training… for last place.",
    "Your gameplay’s as sharp as a spoon.",
    "I’d suggest aiming lessons, but it may be too late.",
    "You’re like the hidden Easter egg no one asked for.",
    "Did you just give up? Because it shows.",
    "You’ve got more holes in your aim than Swiss cheese.",
    "You play like your controller is haunted.",
    "You’re making this too easy. Thanks for the free win.",
    "If noob points were a currency, you’d be loaded.",
    "Trying to impress? You’re impressively bad.",
    "Next time, try aiming for where I actually am.",
    "Your strategy is as clear as mud.",
    "You’re like the opposite of a legend.",
    "I could dodge you with my hands tied behind my back.",
    "Is that all you’ve got? Seriously?",
    "Oh, I felt that… in my funny bone.",
